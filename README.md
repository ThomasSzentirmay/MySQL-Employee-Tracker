# MySQL-Employee-Tracker

## Description

This application is completely in the CLI, and is an employee tracker that tracks employees, their roles, their dpeartments, their managers and their salary, in neat formatted tables. This application has a database running on MySQL, and has a Node JS file to run the user prompts and send the server data to the CLI.

## Installation

Users are welcome to clone the project repo, and run 'npm i' in their terminal to make sure they have all the necessary dependancies to run this program. After that, of course making sure you have node on your machine, you can use this employee tracker for all your needs.

## Usage

Simply follow the prompts in the command line after running 'node index.js', and you will get the desired outcome with the application.

## Credit

ChatGPT assisted with debugging. I am a little annoyed as it made one big suggestion to fix the infinitely looping user prompts, and that suggestion ended up breaking my entire index.js file, which was horrible to go back through and sort out.
